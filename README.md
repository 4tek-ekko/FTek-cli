# Introduction

Mobile Center command line interface is a unified tool for running Mobile Center services from the command line. Our aim is to offer a concise and powerful tool for our developers to use Mobile Center services and easily script a sequence of commands that they'd like to execute. You can currently login and view/configure all the apps that you have access to in Mobile Center.

Although our current feature set is minimal, all the existing Mobile Center services will be added going forward. Note that the Mobile Center CLI is currently in public preview.
